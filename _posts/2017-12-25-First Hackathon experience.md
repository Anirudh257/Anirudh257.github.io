 This is the first article for the website
 
This will be the first article since the inception of this blog. In this article, I will be sharing my experience of attending a Hackathon for the first time. 
      
 A hackathon is a limited time design competition for computer programming and software development. They are not resticted 
to only Computer Science students. Anyone with the drive and interest can participate in Hackathons. Professionals and students 
from all backgrounds participate in these events. These events can be regional, national and even international. A hackathon is 
almost being held every 1-2 weeks. It is an exhilarating learning experience. I urge everyone to participate in a Hackathon atleast once during their college or school time.
      
I don't remember the date clearly. It was sometime halfway through the summer break(May-July). I was half-sleepily browsing 
the Internet to kill my time. I came across the popular competitive programming website, <a href = "https://www.hackerearth.com/">. There were a couple of live Hackathons and completed Hackathons listed on the page. One of them caught my eye-"IndiaHacks". It was an IOT based competition. I recollected my friend mentioning about IOT once. After googling a bit about the competition, I decided to ask my friend about it. He was livid and we both decided to register for the event. 

There were four categories for the topic."Smart driving", "Smart Home","Smart health", "Smart wearable devices". After bandying 
for ideas, we settled on creating a smarter car headlight. It would automatically detect the light in its surroundings and regulate the light coming from it. This would prevent accidents due to high light beams. We filled the idea and registered for the event without any expectations. 
     
It was August 7. I recieve a mail from IndiaHacks saying" You have been selected for Round 2 of the hackathon....". I was 
overjoyed. I didn't consider going through the rest of the mail and called my friend. We both were ecstatic and I informed everyone on my hostel floor. We decided to start working on our idea as soon as possible.
     
The competition was supposed to be held on 26th August. It was a very short period of time for us to clearly refine our ideas
and create a viable product. We started talking to our professors and friends. We planned to buy all the hardware products for 
the competition. We hit our 1st roadblock. None of the shops nearby were open that day and none had all the required devices we 
would be requiring for the product. After calling over 10 shops, we decided to order it from online. 
     
According to our plan, I had to develop a Bluetooth application which emits light and tells the intensity for the same in LUX.
My partner was going to work on the hardware part. He had to use LED sensor and arduino board to emulate an actual car. My work was to be done on android. As I wasn't proficient in Android, I had to start learning from scratch.
