This is the fifteenth article on the website

I have updated the course content with 6th and 7th semester material which can be found <a href = "https://anirudh257.github.io/Course_content/">
here</a>

**Disclaimer** A lot of things might change till you read the list. This is the course content according to
my semester. Professors will change and so will their teaching style. Make changes accordingly. The 6th semester is going to be
really hectic and it is good to start studying from now in your free time. Another important advice is to start preparing for 
interviews by following: <a href = "http://rachitiitr.blogspot.com/2017/07/tutorial-for-how-to-prepare-for.html">Rachit's blog</a>.
Plan accordingly and keep your 7th semester as empty as possible.
