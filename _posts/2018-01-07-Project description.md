I am working on a project on **Audio classification using deep learning**. In this blog post, I will explain my premise behind 
choosing this project and try to explain the problem in layman's words.

Firstly, let's consider **Audio classification**. It is a process of classifying audio data into distinct groups. Classification 
helps in dividing huge chunks of data into useful categories. Human beings have inborn or trained capabilities to distinguish 
between different colours and sounds from the environment. By the age of 2 years, a normal human infant can distinguish between 
different colors and by the age of 4, he can distinguish between different sounds. 

This leads to an interesting question!! When can we build machines that can think for themselves? This human inquisitiveness 
gave rise to this upcoming field of <a href = "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Artificial_intelligence">**Artificial Intelligence**</a>
The goal of this field is to finally create machines which can display equal amounts of intelligence as human beings. The field may
be in vogue right now, but it predates back to about 1956. In the beginning, machines succeeded in accomplishing most of the
routine tasks that humans could do. Tasks which required high amounts of precision, repetition and high amounts of computation 
became very easy for the computers.
