This is my personal blog. I will be using it to pen down my thoughts and write about my projects, interests and my goals in life.
I will also be adding past year question papers, worksheets, and soft copies of text books of my courses.

I created this website by using http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ and also taking inspiration from https://sheikharaf.com/ and https://priyanshrastogi.com/
