	<p>I am working as a research intern at <a href ="https://mbzuai-cv-lab.netlify.app/">Computer Vision Lab</a> at <b>MBZUAI</b>. I am fortunate to be 
	advised by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/sanath-narayan">Dr. Sanath Narayan</a> and
	<a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home">Dr. Fahad Shahbaz Khan</a>. At MBZUAI, I am working on research projects dealing with Few-shot learning and
