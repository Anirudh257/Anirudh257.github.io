	<h1>Hi there, I'm Anirudh Thatipelli!</h1>
	<p>I am working as a research intern at <a href ="https://mbzuai-cv-lab.netlify.app/">Computer Vision Lab</a> at <b>MBZUAI</b>. I am fortunate to be 
	advised by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/sanath-narayan">Dr. Sanath Narayan</a>, 
	<a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home">Dr. Fahad Shahbaz Khan</a> and 
		<a href = "https://salman-h-khan.github.io/">Dr. Salman Khan</a>. At MBZUAI, I am working on research projects dealing with Few-shot learning and
	Action Recognition. Before this, I also spent some fantastic time at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad where I worked under 
	<a href = "https://ravika.github.io/">Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla</a> on the problem of skeleton action recognition. I have also worked at
