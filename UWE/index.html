<p><strong>Graph theory </strong> is one of the most favorite courses that I had in my college life. The professor does a wondeful
job in explaining Graph theory concepts and also makes sure that all the students from varying backgrounds like CSE, Economics, etc
are kept at the same level. The class was discursive and the level waas  streams  Inspite of being a Mathematics course that 
requires proof writing, the grading is lenient on that. Mathematics majors are judged at a slightly higher level as they are 
assumed to already have a good grounding of proofs. The course is completely absolute and one has to score good marks in every 
graded component like the asignments, quizzes and examinations. In my opinion, the assignments and the exams are graded more 
leniently than the quizzes. The assignments are interesting and students are expected to put a good effort in them. They are 
non-trivial and can't be expected to be completed within a day or two. Personally, what helped me to secure a good grade was to 
attend every class and tutorial and do the book-back questions in

<p><strong>Linear Algebra</strong> is the most <strong>important</strong> course that you will have in your college semester.
It forms the basics for many topics like Machine learning, Big Data Analytics, Physics courses, etc. All this makes it a must-do
course. I won't persuade you to take this course in college but it can be done online as well in more depth. There are tons of
wonderful courses online. Some of my favorites are: 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8"><em>MIT linear algebra</em>which is by far the
best content that I have come across in this field. Other good shorter versions are: 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyAuNHPsq-g&list=PLFD0EB975BA0CC1E0"><em>Khan Academy</em></a> and 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B"><em>3Blue1Brown</em></a>. For 
someone who is math-phobic, I recommend reading this excellent book: 
<a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Manga-Guide-Linear-Algebra/dp/1593274130">Manga Guide to Linear Algebra</a>. In my opinion, the
course was slightly advanced and the examinations were pretty challenging. All the questions were application-based problem
solving questions. Practice questions daily from the prescribed book by 
<a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775">Gilbert Strang</a>. In my time, 
owing to the huge demand of this course, there were 2 batches of professors. One used to cover the linear algebra through its
applications and other used to cover it using theory. If you have a chance, take the <strong>theoretical</strong> course. It
is important to build theory from scratch and understand the math properly.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamical Systems</strong>, inspite of its widespread popularity is not something I will recommend. The content is 
good but the rigour and learning is absolutely zero. It gives a good introduction and building block for a study in Chaos
theory but neither the exams or the labs test you on that. We perfunctorily covered some equations in class but never had an
opportunity to derive it further or understand it thoroughly. It is really easy to score and the examinations consist of some
questions that repeat each year. If you have a really hectic semester, it will be helpful to do this as this is a pretty light
course for the number of credits it is being offered for. </p>
