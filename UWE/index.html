<p><strong>Graph theory </strong> is one of the most favorite courses that I had in my college life. The professor does a wondeful
job in explaining Graph theory concepts and also makes sure that all the students from varying backgrounds like CSE, Economics, etc
are kept at the same level. The class was discursive and the level waas  streams  Inspite of being a Mathematics course that 
requires proof writing, the grading is lenient on that. Mathematics majors are judged at a slightly higher level as they are 
assumed to already have a good grounding of proofs. The course is completely absolute and one has to score good marks in every 
graded component like the asignments, quizzes and examinations. In my opinion, the assignments and the exams are graded more
