	<h1>In this blog post, I will be adding the material that I had used for my CCCs.</h1>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IjmZD6hQf3rdN5VerRvS38B2g99qhAvp">EVS</a></p>

<p><strong>EVS</strong> is like a 2-edged sword. Inspite of its uselessness, it is a pretty heavy credit course(4). It has a 
great weightage and can literally sink or improve your grade substantially. Most classes are unsimulating and there are too many
slides that are needed to be covered. It is good to create a condensed slide version for exam preparation. Another important 
part of this course is the field trip project. It is important to follow all the guidelines specified by the respective professor
to get a good grade in this. It is not very difficult. It is helpful to complete CCC credits.</p>

  
 
  
<p><strong>Disclaimer: A lot of things might have changed till the time that you take the course. Take the advice here after 
weighing all the important facts in your mind.</strong></p>
