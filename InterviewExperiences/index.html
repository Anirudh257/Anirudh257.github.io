                                              <h1>Dell Interview Experience</h1>      
      
     <p>For the first time, the Dell Interview's process was held through a hackathon. The problems were given to us in advance and 
everyone had to get separated into teams of 4. Most of the problems were trying to solve some problem through the use Artificial 
intelligence.They encompassed both pressing social and technical problems that were solved or being solved by Dell.</p>
     <p>Our team was given the problem statement titled 
<b>Using Artificial Intelligence to solve new product demand and forecasting</b>. Till 2 days before the hackathon, we researched 
extensively on this topic. Since this problem involved both web development and machine learning, we split our team into 2 
sub-teams of 2. As I had already worked on machine learning earlier, I paired up with another friend who had experience in 
Regression analysis.</p> 
     <p>In the Hackathon, we were judged by Dell committee members who had prior experience in these areas and guided us too. While 
the hackathon ensued, the judges regularly took feedback and asked us questions about our progress and gave some essential advice 
for the actual presentation the following day. We toiled till the whole day and night and completed our product.</p>
     <p>The presentation took about 10 minutes in which all team members had to present the product to the Dell committee members. 
The time constraint was very strict and the product demo was the most important component. They asked us questions regarding the 
viability of the product, <b>Test Driven Development</b>, <b>Extreme pair programming</b>, and how we individually had contributed
to the project.</p>
     <p>After judging a few teams, the committee shortlisted approximately from the presentations for the behavioral interview. 
In this interview, candidates were judged upon soft skills and culture fit to the company. Some of the questions that were asked 
were:
<ul>
  <li> What are your hobbies?</li>
  
  <li> What are your future plans?</li>

  <li> Questions about your resume?</li>

  <li> Do you have any question for the HR?</li>
</ul> 
 
After this interview, they shortlisted 16-17 students for the final job offer at Dell.</p>
                                       
<h1>ZS Associates Interview Experience</h1>

        <p> ZS Associates had 3-4 rounds of interviews. The first round consisted of 55 aptitude questions including Database
questions. The round got over in 55 minutes. After passing some threshold, a candidate is directed to the next round, which is
the psychometric(video round). In this round, we are asked behavioural and cultural fit questions like <b>What are your biggest
strengths, weaknesses?</b>, <b>Tell me about a time where you worked in a team?</b>. After this, some 20 odd students were 
shortlisted for the next round to be held in Gurgaon office of ZS Associates. </p>

        <p>There were 2-3 rounds here. The first and the most rigorous round was the <b>Case study round</b>. A case study
related to some problem is given and a candidate has to solve it in a very short period of time, 30 minutes. The case study
was extremely rigorous and was 12-pages long. It had a lot of tables and a question was asked whether this information can be
condensed to fewer tables. This required a good knowledge of database concepts. A lot of grilling was done after the solution
was presented. The interviewers wanted a very elaborate study.</p> 
 
        <p>The next round was a guesstimate interview. These questions judge the candidate's ability to guess insantly and 
be unfazed even on some grilling. The answer is not important but the process to get to it is judged intensely. This round 
might be followed by another puzzle round or a behavioural interview. The resume is scrutinized heavily and be ready to answer
some questions about programming languages mentioned there. Be careful not to go overboard in your resume.</p>

        <p>This was the interview experience for the role of <b>Business technology analyst</b>. Other roles might have 
slightly different interviews. The speciality of ZS Interview process is its unpredictability and so it should not be 
surprising to see many differences from the current interview process.</p>
