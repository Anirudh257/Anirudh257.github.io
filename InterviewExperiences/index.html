                                              <h1>Dell Interview Experience</h1>      
      
     <p>For the first time, the Dell Interview's process was held through a hackathon. The problems were given to us in advance and 
everyone had to get separated into teams of 4. Most of the problems were trying to solve some problem through the use Artificial 
intelligence.They encompassed both pressing social and technical problems that were solved or being solved by Dell.</p>
     <p>Our team was given the problem statement titled **Using Artificial Intelligence to solve new product demand and forecasting**.
Till 2 days before the hackathon, we researched extensively on this topic. Since this problem involved both web development and 
machine learning, we split our team into 2 sub-teams of 2. As I had already worked on machine learning earlier, I paired up with 
another friend who had experience in Regression analysis.</p> 
     <p>In the Hackathon, we were judged by Dell committee members who had prior experience in these areas and guided us too. While 
the hackathon ensued, the judges regularly took feedback and asked us questions about our progress and gave some essential advice 
for the actual presentation the following day. We toiled till the whole day and night and completed our product.</p>
     <p>The presentation took about 10 minutes in which all team members had to present the product to the Dell committee members. 
The time constraint was very strict and the product demo was the most important component. They asked us questions regarding the 
viability of the product, <b>Test Driven Development</b>, <b>Extreme pair programming</b>, and how we individually had contributed
to the project.</p>
     <p>After judging a few teams, the committee shortlisted approximately from the presentations for the behavioral interview. 
In this interview, candidates were judged upon soft skills and culture fit to the company. Some of the questions that were asked were:
<ul>
  <li> What are your hobbies?</li>
  
  <li> What are your future plans?</li>

  <li> Questions about your resume?</li>

  <li> Do you have any question for the HR?</li>
</ul>
 
After this interview, they shortlisted 16-17 students for the final job offer at Dell.</p>
