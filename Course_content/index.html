<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vtdMu7kb_Zx1X0eJ3pM6rZaksrUSFasW" >Computer Architecture</a> </p>

<p><strong>Computer Architecture</strong> is a very important course. It is mostly numerical and it is crucial to have a good hang of 
problem solving to ace this course. Don't leave anything to the last day and keep solving a lot of questions.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/189Tv5PbapLQpPelH8gM5RwjpjcRLjdLf" >Operating Systems</a> </p>

<p><strong>Operating Systems</strong> is also another important course. Again, problem solving is very important in the course.</p>
<p>Be thorough with the topic given in the book before every class. Worship this site <a href = "https://sites.google.com/a/snu.edu.in/shashi-prabh/teaching/operating-systems-2017">OS</a></p>
<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nmjDiwZR7nd_Tvg7IEg2xYTRIWPaXIsv" >Probability and Statistics</a> </p>

<p><strong>Probability and Statistics</strong> is a mathematics course. It is essential to understand the concepts of Statistics
like c-value, etc. Keep solving questions and this course will be like a breeze.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dVUiWGIJ8NaRczlb_U2stbJjRaJlH27S" >Database and Management Systems</a> </p>

<p><strong>Database and Management Systems</strong> is a compleletely application-based course. It will have an enormous syllabus
(over 30 slides ) and will require rote learning. Keep good notes and don't leave everything upto the last day. This course also 
has a project component and it will be better to start off as early as possible. </p>

<p><strong>General tips</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> To augment your understanding, use online lectures like <a href ="http://www.nptel.ac.in/" >NPTEL</a>,
      <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjC1hn78yZqTf0vdTC6wAQ" >Ravindrababu Ravula</a>,

</li>
<li> Visit professors in their office hours for doubts or ask friends or seniors</li>
</ol>

	<h1>Following the success of the earlier blog, I have created another list of my 2nd semester material</h1>
	
<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_tn54mWFW9V1xHPB3lrfk1AARampWDJs" >Data Structures</a></p>

<p><strong>Data Structures</strong> is the most crucial course of CS ( and your life :)). Having a good grip over data structures and algorithms becomes
crucial in your pursuit of having a dream job, high GATE ranking, competitive programming,etc. For this course, follow this process:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>Read about the algorithm in the book before the class.
	</li>
	<li> Understand the pseudocode thoroughly.
	</li>
	<li> Write the algorithm by yourself in C or any other language.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoroughly utilise these two sources: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iQJOZ2ktpwDuyGqEGwZSRkpjM86C4ANM">Cormen</a>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y32Y8cGw2053njjOGQCqhxL1JNt-FkVl" >Mathematics</a></p>

<p><strong>Mathematics</strong> is a very easy course. Just attend all the lectures, read the book and solve the tutorials.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n6Ph0peWiHL0yUdyADuXaqh5qobURlbR" >Physics</a></p>

<p><strong>Physics</strong> is the most <strong>important</strong> course of this semester. It is worth 5 credits which makes it a 
gamble. Traditionally, students( esp. me) have suffered a lot in Physics exams. A bad grade in this course can mess up your overall 
grade. To get a good grade, you have to attend all the classes religiously, tutorials and understand every question being taught in 
the tutorials. </p>
	


<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> I made this list according to my lectures pertaining to my semester in 2017. A lot of things
 would have changed till the time you see it. Make changes accordingly.</p>
