<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vtdMu7kb_Zx1X0eJ3pM6rZaksrUSFasW" >Computer Architecture</a> </p>

<p><strong>Computer Architecture</strong> is a very important course. It is mostly numerical and it is crucial to have a good hang of 
problem solving to ace this course. Don't leave anything to the last day and keep solving a lot of questions.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/189Tv5PbapLQpPelH8gM5RwjpjcRLjdLf" >Operating Systems</a> </p>

<p><strong>Operating Systems</strong> is also another important course. Again, problem solving is very important in the course.</p>
<p>Be thorough with the topic given in the book before every class. Worship this site <a href = "https://sites.google.com/a/snu.edu.in/shashi-prabh/teaching/operating-systems-2017">OS</a></p>
<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nmjDiwZR7nd_Tvg7IEg2xYTRIWPaXIsv" >Probability and Statistics</a> </p>

<p><strong>Probability and Statistics</strong> is a mathematics course. It is essential to understand the concepts of Statistics
like c-value, etc. Keep solving questions and this course will be like a breeze.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eJ0vVL6hnOo0SBStf3etO6tm751hsPe2" >Database and Management Systems</a> </p>

<p><strong>Database and Management Systems</strong> is a compleletely application-based course. It will have an enormous syllabus
(over 30 slides ) and will require rote learning. Keep good notes and don't leave everything upto the last day. This course also 
has a project component and it will be better to start off as early as possible. For exams, it will be helpful to go through

	<h1>Following the success of the earlier blog, I have created another list of my 2nd semester material</h1>
	
<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_tn54mWFW9V1xHPB3lrfk1AARampWDJs" >Data Structures</a></p>

<p><strong>Data Structures</strong> is the most crucial course of CS ( and your life :)). Having a good grip over data structures and algorithms becomes
crucial in your pursuit of having a dream job, high GATE ranking, competitive programming,etc. For this course, follow this process:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>Read about the algorithm in the book before the class.
	</li>
	<li> Understand the pseudocode thoroughly.
	</li>
	<li> Write the algorithm by yourself in C or any other language.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoroughly utilise these two sources: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iQJOZ2ktpwDuyGqEGwZSRkpjM86C4ANM">Cormen</a> 
and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/">Geeks for Geeks</a></p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y32Y8cGw2053njjOGQCqhxL1JNt-FkVl" >Mathematics</a></p>

<p><strong>Mathematics</strong> is a very easy course. Just attend all the lectures, read the book and solve the tutorials.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n6Ph0peWiHL0yUdyADuXaqh5qobURlbR" >Physics</a></p>

<p><strong>Physics</strong> is the most <strong>important</strong> course of this semester. It is worth 5 credits which makes it a 
gamble. Traditionally, students( esp. me) have suffered a lot in Physics exams. A bad grade in this course can mess up your overall 
grade. To get a good grade, you have to attend all the classes religiously, tutorials and understand every question being taught in 
the tutorials. </p>
	
	<h1>I will now update this website with stack of ebooks, test papers and other important material which I used in my 5th semester
	of study.</h1>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KDz2Zi4Q3fKNjZi1MM_s1qTFHladHg4l">Computer Networks</a></p>

<p><strong>Computer Networks</strong> is one of the core Computer Science subjects and plays a huge role in your placement and Gate 
preparation.It is also very interesting to study and there are a lot of unsolved problems in the field. Tannebaum's 
<a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YjBsowDSh6tivl6ViCvZqoxb5pUJCoEL">book</a> does a fantastic job in explaining all the 
concepts properly and is significantly useful for people who wish to delve deeper in the subject. For doubts, one can always to refer to
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMIxCYZu8o&list=PLEbnTDJUr_IegfoqO4iPnPYQui46QqT0j">Ravindrababu's</a> lucid explanation. 
Solving the book back questions and attending all labs would ensure a great grade in the course.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qiXkaGrLDvTeS9O1DMvW07l39hXHqQ33?usp=sharing">Software engineering</a></p>

<p><strong>Software Engineering</strong> is not the core but prepares you for the actual life after the university. Although, it is not
important to learn everything by heart here, it is important to understand certain concepts. The humongous material might be an 
impediment which can be easily conquered through preparation of concise slides as I did 
<a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTgARCzobQq7MvQlCFq_rUfuJV-nOEY-/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. One can also use flashcards 
and space repetition techniques to digest the important information before exams. I strongly advise to work hard in projects and try to 
solve lesser known problems. Good time management is required as the project would require a huge time commitment.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SeKism3b9d80G1KVq2wElf8grMmVv5VI?usp=sharing">Systems Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>Systems programming</strong> was the first elective that I had taken. It is a symbiosis of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science. It also seems familiar to Computer Architecture. It is enjoyable for hardware enthusiasts. I am not sure if this course would be
taken again, though.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EkQ7dqgbAX1wDEiyppJcfjBiQFdZ8ghC?usp=sharing">Artificial intelligence</a></p>

<p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> is one of the disruptors in this 21st century. This course gives a basic flavor of AI to 
students. It is important to study regularly as the concepts are slow to immerse in mind. Some good online courses can be found 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1S-HSakPTM&list=PLIZQvCoJVokgKBNx210mkXEk4FeSOGfWu">here</a>. Another great source that I 
used to revise is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7LqgglEfQw&list=PL9zFgBale5fug7z_YlD9M0x8gdZ7ziXen">this</a>.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dqhM8AJiTA4UrLwULje4CW_JF_aVRIz9?usp=sharing">Advanced Database Management Systems</a></p>

<p><strong>Advanced Database Managment Systems</strong> along with Networks forms a core subject required in Gate and Interview 
Preparation. In spite of being offered as an elective, I think that this course is very important in Big Data Analytics and other jobs 
due to pervasive nature of Databases. For doubts, I referred 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wez3fXrjBAE&list=PLmXKhU9FNesR1rSES7oLdJaNFgmuj0SYV">here</a> and
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHAfc7Hjq28&list=PLWPirh4EWFpGrpcMfZ6UcdI786QdtSxV8">here</a>. I have also put some videos 
to download from my <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y4G9CoA-qHzXq-CGQ1u0Xw3DcaHpJcBo?usp=sharing">drive</a>. The
best part is that there is no need for rote learning and it is important to have a grasp over the different concepts to crack the exams.
This can be achieved through practice of questions from <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/">GeeksForGeeks</a></p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1amVyYdDmQmRbdqIhgQDRm1T0ULI4fcKL">Signals and Systems</a></p>
	
<p><strong>Signals and Systems</strong> is an important course for someone who is interested in Computer Vision and image processing. It 
is a basic introduction to signal processing concepts like Fourier analysis,etc. What personally helped me was this
<a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8rsR_TStaA&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhG6s3jYIU48CqsT5cyiDTO">Playlist</a>. A better resource can be
to study directly from the man himself who wrote the book
<a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I0UeAzp7SmH1Cvk-wDcMrm6aUnJw7qCT">here</a>.These lectures and practice of the 
book-back questions should ensure that this course is a breeze.</p>
	
<p><strong>This semester was light for me. I am not sure it would be the same for your batch. If it is, I strongly recommend completing
extra UWE and CCC credits during the same.</strong></p>

	<h1>The following content comprises of the material that I had used in my 3rd semester of study.</h1>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ra1bT6hOycpsIiQNkt_c89Gd1YwHpAnt">Computer Organization</a></p>

<p><strong>Computer Organization</strong> forms a precursor to Computer Architecture course which would be taught in the 5th semester.
It is a course which lies in the intersection of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Being a conceptual subject, it is important
to practice the book-back questions thoroughly. I found that the 
<a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zMG5OP2cvr6kDT8o57Ypz1YEc-WG3Jnk">book</a> did good justice in explaining the concepts. As 
always <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyu5RKDwkTA&list=PLEbnTDJUr_IdI9QZ7bkrhMX2ZpNW0dZUo">Ravindra Babu's lectures</a>
succeed in teaching the concepts very well. 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iir5Pz3kq0w&list=PLWPirh4EWFpF0FVeBgL75d1RlASn4sGoz">TutorialsPoint</a>is another underrated
resource which remains untapped. Good grade is predetermined by practice.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VvIqjGTWYRvXH_VJWithecH39AehXsIa">Digital Electronics</a></p>

<p><strong>Digital Electronics</strong> is a heavy 5 credit course which can make or break your grade. Surprisingly, I found it more easier
than Physics and more enjoyable too. Never miss the labs and with some practice, you can ensure a good score on the practical exams.
Ironically, in the course, the difficulty doesn't lie in the difficulty of the exams but is more towards time management. It is important
that your concepts are crystal clear and time is taken care off. Surprise tests ensured that everyone was on their knees. I found the 
lectures were good enough. For revision, I used 
<a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0mx8S05v60&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjMH3mWf6kwqiTbT798eAOm">Neso Academy</a>. Since it has such high
credits, I suggest that one attends all the classes and labs of this course and practices regularly.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BtJUlHD4dsXJbA5DhSX4DGBmQ1i2Plpp">Discrete Mathematics</a></p>


<p><strong>Discrete Mathematics</strong> forms the basis of Graph Theory and teaches some important number theory techniques which might
be helpful for CAT and other aptitude exams. It will also teach about proofs which is essential in higher level mathematics courses. 
There are a lot of practice questions and assignment questions which should be enough for this course.</p> 

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bPCa7gks4Mbo7nIPYWb2sjCqRnBIKFnw?usp=sharing">Java</a></p>


<p><strong>Java</strong> is one of the most important coding languages used in the world and offers some unbounded potential to its user.
For this course, practice of OOPs concepts is essential which can be found at 
<a href ="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/">GeeksforGeeks</a>. If you aren't comfortable with it, you can take this amazing free 
<a href = "https://courses.caveofprogramming.com/p/java-for-complete-beginners">course</a>. This 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBWX97e1E9g&list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19">playlist</a> can help you in the same too. You should
also learn how to use the documentation efficiently. The only issue that I had faced is management of time for the project. I recommend 
that you learn Java efficiently in this 1 month of time and start brainstorming on project ideas and start working as soon as possible.
Try to work on unique prokjects which can solve problems of your life. Cool ideas can be found

	<h1>This is a stack of all ebooks, lectures, tutorials that I had used while I was in my 1st semester.</h1>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qqmA69T7x17zs2hw2Xucg1jIn4W3VuxY">Mathematical methods</a></p>

<p><strong>Mathematical Methods</strong> is the first Mathematical course which is offered to you. It is a pretty easy course and has
a very easy grading scale too. It shouldn't be very hard to get A grades by attending the classes and doing the assignments on time. I 
stress that one should attend the tutorials as many of the questions solved in the tutorial are directly asked in the paper.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R86jtkxnlQOCOFVFaPxvqMeK0Iy99tS7">Introduction to programming in C</a></p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Computer Programming</strong> might seem intimidating for someone who doesn't have any coding practice till 
date. This course does a good job to introducing the basic programming concepts like pointers, recursion, iteration, etc. For doubts, 
you can refer to this wonderful online course, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/cs50tv/featured">CS50</a> by Harvard. You can 
always ask your seniors, friends in case of doubts.</p>
	
<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kzi_VwVJ8xrS4Y2pLMTnK6JxJ4VT2Mo4">Electronics</a></p>

<p><strong>Electronics</strong> is a basic course covering circuits, Kirchoff's law, etc some of which would be familiar to you as a part 
of your 12th Standard Physics curriculum. I personally found this course slightly difficult. Most of the questions asked in the exams are
from the example and book back questions from 
<a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8YBJW2kTUlQRx1C7-CNd38rWIKqUTbA/view?usp=sharing">Boylistad</a>. Tutorial questions are also
very useful in giving a taste of the actual exam papers. One can always attend the LASC, ask seniors, TA for doubts.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g1A4RXWZsFld_AQj1Yj_2YIxX_ABPtzJ">Physics</a></p>

<p><strong>Physics</strong> was the most difficult course for me during my first semester. Inspite of the questions being of the same 
level as our 11th and 12th standard, I found it really difficult to navigate through the course. I really found 
<a href = "https://nptel.ac.in/course.php">NPTEL</a> lectures very useful. Solving 
<a href = "https://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Mechanics-Daniel-Kleppner/dp/0521198119">Kleppner</a>'s bookback and sample questions listed
was enough for scoring a good grade. Do attend the LASCs, reach out to TAs or seniors for help!</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> I made this list according to my lectures pertaining to my college course. A lot of things
 would have changed till the time you see it. Make changes accordingly.</p>
