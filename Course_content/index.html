<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vtdMu7kb_Zx1X0eJ3pM6rZaksrUSFasW" >Computer Architecture</a> </p>

<p><strong>Computer Architecture</strong> is a very important course. It is mostly numerical and it is crucial to have a good hang of 
problem solving to ace this course. Don't leave anything to the last day and keep solving a lot of questions.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/189Tv5PbapLQpPelH8gM5RwjpjcRLjdLf" >Operating Systems</a> </p>

<p><strong>Operating Systems</strong> is also another important course. Again, problem solving is very important in the course.</p>
<p>Be thorough with the topic given in the book before every class. Worship this site <a href = "https://sites.google.com/a/snu.edu.in/shashi-prabh/teaching/operating-systems-2017">OS</a></p>
<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nmjDiwZR7nd_Tvg7IEg2xYTRIWPaXIsv" >Probability and Statistics</a> </p>

<p><strong>Probability and Statistics</strong> is a mathematics course. It is essential to understand the concepts of Statistics
like c-value, etc. Keep solving questions and this course will be like a breeze.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dVUiWGIJ8NaRczlb_U2stbJjRaJlH27S" >Database and Management Systems</a> </p>

<p><strong>Database and Management Systems</strong> is a compleletely application-based course. It will have an enormous syllabus
(over 30 slides ) and will require rote learning. Keep good notes and don't leave everything upto the last day. This course also 
has a project component and it will be better to start off as early as possible. For exams, it will be helpful to go through

<p><strong>General tips</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> To augment your understanding, use online lectures like <a href ="http://www.nptel.ac.in/" >NPTEL</a>,
      <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjC1hn78yZqTf0vdTC6wAQ" >Ravindrababu Ravula</a>,
      <a href ="https://www.khanacademy.org/" >Khan Academy</a>
</li>
<li> Visit professors in their office hours for doubts or ask friends or seniors</li>
</ol>

	<h1>Following the success of the earlier blog, I have created another list of my 2nd semester material</h1>
	
<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_tn54mWFW9V1xHPB3lrfk1AARampWDJs" >Data Structures</a></p>

<p><strong>Data Structures</strong> is the most crucial course of CS ( and your life :)). Having a good grip over data structures and algorithms becomes
crucial in your pursuit of having a dream job, high GATE ranking, competitive programming,etc. For this course, follow this process:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>Read about the algorithm in the book before the class.
	</li>
	<li> Understand the pseudocode thoroughly.
	</li>
	<li> Write the algorithm by yourself in C or any other language.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoroughly utilise these two sources: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iQJOZ2ktpwDuyGqEGwZSRkpjM86C4ANM">Cormen</a> 
and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/">Geeks for Geeks</a></p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y32Y8cGw2053njjOGQCqhxL1JNt-FkVl" >Mathematics</a></p>

<p><strong>Mathematics</strong> is a very easy course. Just attend all the lectures, read the book and solve the tutorials.</p>

<p><a href ="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n6Ph0peWiHL0yUdyADuXaqh5qobURlbR" >Physics</a></p>

<p><strong>Physics</strong> is the most <strong>important</strong> course of this semester. It is worth 5 credits which makes it a 
gamble. Traditionally, students( esp. me) have suffered a lot in Physics exams. A bad grade in this course can mess up your overall 
grade. To get a good grade, you have to attend all the classes religiously, tutorials and understand every question being taught in 
the tutorials. </p>
	
	<h1>I will now update this website with stack of ebooks, test papers and other important material which I used in my 5th semester
	of study.</h1>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KDz2Zi4Q3fKNjZi1MM_s1qTFHladHg4l">Computer Networks</a></p>

<p><strong>Computer Networks</strong> is one of the core Computer Science subjects and plays a huge role in your placement and Gate 
preparation.It is also very interesting to study and there are a lot of unsolved problems in the field. Tannebaum's 
<a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YjBsowDSh6tivl6ViCvZqoxb5pUJCoEL">book</a> does a fantastic job in explaining all the 
concepts properly and is significantly useful for people who wish to delve deeper in the subject. For doubts, one can always to refer to
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMIxCYZu8o&list=PLEbnTDJUr_IegfoqO4iPnPYQui46QqT0j">Ravindrababu's</a> lucid explanation. 
Solving the book back questions and attending all labs would ensure a great grade in the course.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qiXkaGrLDvTeS9O1DMvW07l39hXHqQ33?usp=sharing">Software engineering</a></p>

<p><strong>Software Engineering</strong>is not the core but prepares you for the actual life after the university. Although, it is not
important to learn everything by heart here, it is important to understand certain concepts. The humongous material might be an 
impediment which can be easily conquered through preparation of concise slides as I did 
<a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTgARCzobQq7MvQlCFq_rUfuJV-nOEY-/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. One can also use flashcards 
and space repetition techniques to digest the important information before exams. I strongly advise to work hard in projects and try to 
solve lesser known problems. Good time management is required as the project would require a huge time commitment.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SeKism3b9d80G1KVq2wElf8grMmVv5VI?usp=sharing">Systems Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>Systems programming</strong> was the first elective that I had taken. It is a symbiosis of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science. It also seems familiar to Computer Architecture. It is enjoyable for hardware enthusiasts. I am not sure if this course would be
taken again, though.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EkQ7dqgbAX1wDEiyppJcfjBiQFdZ8ghC?usp=sharing">Artificial intelligence</a></p>

<p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> is one of the disruptors in this 21st century. This course gives a basic flavor of AI to 
students. It is important to study regularly as the concepts are slow to immerse in mind. Some good online courses can be found 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1S-HSakPTM&list=PLIZQvCoJVokgKBNx210mkXEk4FeSOGfWu">here</a>. Another great source that I 
used to revise is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7LqgglEfQw&list=PL9zFgBale5fug7z_YlD9M0x8gdZ7ziXen">this</a>.</p>

<p><a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dqhM8AJiTA4UrLwULje4CW_JF_aVRIz9?usp=sharing">Advanced Database Management Systems</a></p>

<p><strong>Advanced Database Managment Systems</strong>along with Networks forms a core subject required in Gate and Interview 
Preparation. In spite of being offered as an elective, I think that this course is very important in Big Data Analytics and other jobs 
due to pervasive nature of Databases. For doubts, I referred 
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wez3fXrjBAE&list=PLmXKhU9FNesR1rSES7oLdJaNFgmuj0SYV">here</a> and
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHAfc7Hjq28&list=PLWPirh4EWFpGrpcMfZ6UcdI786QdtSxV8">here</a>. I have also put some videos 
to download from my <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y4G9CoA-qHzXq-CGQ1u0Xw3DcaHpJcBo?usp=sharing">drive</a>. The
best part is that there is no need for rote learning and it is important to have a grasp over the different concepts to crack the exams.
This can be achieved through practice of questions from <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/">GeeksForGeeks</a></p>

<p><strong>This was one of the lightest semesters in my coursework. I strongly recommend that this should be used for completion
of extra credits in the form of UWEs and CCCs.</strong></p>







<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> I made this list according to my lectures pertaining to my semester in 2017. A lot of things
 would have changed till the time you see it. Make changes accordingly.</p>
